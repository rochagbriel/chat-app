# Chat App(React Native)

Welcome to 'Chat App' a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app
provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their
location.

## Technologies Used

This app was developed using the following technologies:

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps.

In addition to the above technologies, the following tools were used during development:

- Expo Client App: The Expo Client App is a mobile app that allows developers to test and preview their Expo projects directly on iOS and Android devices. It provides a convenient way to view and interact with the app during development without the need for separate device emulators.
- Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. It provides a rich set of tools, including an emulator for testing and debugging Android apps.
